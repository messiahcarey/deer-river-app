## üö® Critical UI/UX Issues & Improvement Opportunities

### 1. **Navigation & Information Architecture**

#### Issues:
- **Shallow Navigation**: Only 3 main pages, no sub-navigation or deep linking
- **Missing Dashboard**: No overview/analytics on the home page
- **No Breadcrumbs**: Users can't easily navigate back through complex workflows
- **Limited Context**: No way to see related data across different sections

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**High Priority:**
- Add a comprehensive dashboard with key metrics and recent activity
- Implement breadcrumb navigation for complex workflows
- Add quick access panels showing related data (e.g., person's faction info on map)
- Create a unified search across all entities

**Medium Priority:**
- Add sub-navigation for complex sections (e.g., People ‚Üí Residents, Visitors, etc.)
- Implement deep linking for specific records
- Add "Recently Viewed" functionality
```

### 2. **Data Visualization & Analytics**

#### Issues:
- **No Visual Data**: Everything is text-based tables and lists
- **Missing Insights**: No analytics, trends, or relationship visualizations
- **Poor Overview**: Can't see the "big picture" of town dynamics
- **No Reporting**: No way to generate reports or summaries

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**High Priority:**
- Add interactive map visualization showing building locations and relationships
- Create faction relationship diagrams showing alliances/rivalries
- Implement population demographics charts (species, age, occupation)
- Add timeline view for faction membership changes

**Medium Priority:**
- Create opinion/relationship network visualization
- Add resource flow diagrams
- Implement event timeline with filtering
- Add exportable reports (PDF, CSV)
```

### 3. **Workflow & Productivity**

#### Issues:
- **Repetitive Tasks**: No bulk operations for common workflows
- **No Workflow Automation**: Everything requires manual step-by-step processes
- **Limited Templates**: No way to quickly create similar entities
- **No Undo/Redo**: Mistakes require manual correction

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**High Priority:**
- Add workflow templates (e.g., "New Refugee Family" creates person + household + assignments)
- Implement bulk operations for common tasks (assign multiple people to faction)
- Add undo/redo functionality for recent changes
- Create quick action buttons for frequent operations

**Medium Priority:**
- Add workflow automation (e.g., auto-assign new residents to appropriate factions)
- Implement change tracking and audit logs
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Create custom dashboard widgets
```

### 4. **Advanced Relationship Management**

#### Issues:
- **Limited Opinion System**: Basic person-to-person opinions, no faction opinions
- **No Relationship History**: Can't track how relationships change over time
- **Missing Social Dynamics**: No way to model complex social interactions
- **No Conflict Resolution**: No tools for managing disputes or rivalries

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**High Priority:**
- Implement faction-to-faction opinion system
- Add relationship history tracking with timeline view
- Create conflict resolution workflow
- Add social influence modeling (who influences whom)

**Medium Priority:**
- Implement event-driven relationship changes
- Add reputation system for individuals and factions
- Create social network analysis tools
- Add relationship prediction algorithms
```

### 5. **Mobile & Accessibility**

#### Issues:
- **Mobile Unfriendly**: Tables don't work well on small screens
- **No Accessibility Features**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Poor Touch Targets**: Buttons and links too small for touch
- **No Offline Support**: Requires constant internet connection

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**High Priority:**
- Redesign tables for mobile with card-based layouts
- Add proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Implement touch-friendly interface elements
- Add progressive web app (PWA) capabilities

**Medium Priority:**
- Add offline data caching
- Implement voice commands for accessibility
- Create mobile-specific workflows
- Add haptic feedback for mobile interactions
```

  activeConflicts: Conflict[]
  resourceStatus: ResourceSummary[]
}
```

### 2. **Interactive Map Visualization**
```typescript
// New component: InteractiveMap
interface MapNode {
  id: string
  type: 'building' | 'person' | 'faction'
  position: { x: number; y: number }
  data: any
  connections: string[]
}
```

### 3. **Advanced Filtering System**
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering with saved filters
interface SavedFilter {
  id: string
  name: string
  filters: FilterCriteria
  isPublic: boolean
  createdBy: string
}
```

### 4. **Relationship Visualization**
```typescript
// New component: RelationshipNetwork
interface RelationshipNode {
  id: string
  type: 'person' | 'faction'
  name: string
  connections: {
    target: string
    relationship: 'allied' | 'rival' | 'neutral' | 'unknown'
    strength: number
  }[]
}
```
